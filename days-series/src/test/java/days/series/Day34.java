     * 1️⃣ What Is Modular Testing and Why Is It Important?
     * 📌 Question: What is modular testing and how does it benefit automation
     * frameworks?
     * 
     * Modular Testing is a software testing technique where an application is
     * broken down into smaller, independent modules, and each module is tested
     * separately.
     * 
     * In automation frameworks, this means creating reusable test components for
     * different parts of the system (like login, search, or checkout).
     * 
     * | Benefit | Description |
     * | ------------------------ |
     * -------------------------------------------------- |
     * | 🔁 **Reusability** | Modules can be reused across multiple test cases |
     * | 🧩 **Maintainability** | Changes in one module don’t affect the whole suite
     * |
     * | ⚙️ **Scalability** | Easier to scale and manage large test suites |
     * | 🔍 **Isolation of Bugs** | Easier to identify which module is failing |
     * | 🧪 **Faster Debugging** | Focused testing of smaller chunks saves time |

     * 2️⃣ What Is the Use of testng.xml and Why Should You Use It?
     * 📌 Question: What is testng.xml and how does it enhance TestNG test
     * execution?
     * 
     * testng.xml is the configuration file for the TestNG testing framework.
     * It allows you to define and control which test classes, methods, and groups
     * to run, and how they should be executed.
     * 
     * | Feature | Benefit |
     * | --------------------------- |
     * ----------------------------------------------------------- |
     * | ✅ **Test Suite Management** | Organize multiple classes into a single suite
     * |
     * | ✅ **Selective Execution** | Run specific tests, methods, or groups |
     * | ✅ **Parameterization** | Pass test data via `<parameter>` tags |
     * | ✅ **Parallel Execution** | Run tests concurrently to save time |
     * | ✅ **Group-Based Testing** | Include/exclude test groups (e.g.,
     * `@Test(groups="smoke")`) |

     * 3️⃣ What Is the Difference Between git fetch and git pull?
     * 📌 Question: How is git fetch different from git pull in GitLab workflows?
     * 
     * ✅ Answer:
     * git fetch: Downloads the latest changes from the remote without merging them
     * into your current branch.
     * git pull: Fetches and automatically merges remote changes into your local
     * branch.

     * 4️⃣ What Are the Different Levels of Testing?
     * 📌 Question: What are the levels of software testing, and what do they focus
     * on?
     * 
     * Levels of testing represent stages in the software testing lifecycle, each
     * focusing on different parts of the system — from individual components to the
     * entire application.
     * 
     * | Level | Focus Area | Who Performs It | Purpose |
     * | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
     * --------------------------- |
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
     * | **1. Unit Testing** | Individual components (methods/functions) |
     * Developers | Validate logic in **smallest testable parts** |
     * | **2. Integration Testing** | Interaction between components or modules |
     * Developers/Testers | Check **data flow** between units/modules |
     * | **3. System Testing** | Entire application as a whole | Testers (QA) |
     * Ensure the **complete system** works as expected |
     * | **4. Acceptance Testing** | Application from user/business perspective |
     * QA, Product Owners, Clients | Verify it meets **business requirements** and
     * is ready for release |
